I'm a graduate student at QMUL EECS advised by [Gianni Antichi](https://gianniantichi.github.io/)
. I'm also working with [Brent Stephens](https://www.cs.utah.edu/~brent/)
 at Utah. My interests centers around computer systems at data centers.

#### What am I currently working on?
Old problems never get old!  

#### Some thoughts
Hosts can get congested too, [here for more]({{ site.baseurl }}/hcongestion)  
TCP seems to be hampering the innovation.  
The process of conducting research is slow.  
Pipelined academic collaborations does not sound quite right.
