I am a Linux Kernel Engineer at Huawei Research Cambridge. I am also a visiting researcher at Cambridge University, working at Systems Research Group, which sadly does not exist anymore, under Andrew Moore. I got my PhD from Queen Mary University of London, advised by [Gianni Antichi](https://gianniantichi.github.io/) and [Brent Stephens](https://www.cs.utah.edu/~brent/) at Utah/Google. I was more than fortunate to work with Gianni and Brent; they both have their own styles.  

My interests center around computer systems at data centers. Before starting PhD, I was initially an Intern and then a Research Assistant at NUS advised by [Djordje Jevdjic](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/cs/people/jevdjic/), working on memory management for data center applications. I also spent three months studying the feasibility of using virtualization to increase the availability of electrical grid controllers, advised by [Jean-Yves Le Boudec](https://people.epfl.ch/jean-yves.leboudec) at EPFL. Btw, Lausanne is beautiful.

I did my undergraduate and master's at IUST in Iran, working with [Mohsen Sharifi](https://webpages.iust.ac.ir/msharifi/), where I spent two years as a student at his laboratory.

#### Some thoughts
- Hosts can get congested too, [here for more]({{ site.baseurl }}/hcongestion)  
- TCP seems to be hampering the innovation.  
- The process of conducting research is slow.  
- People should try to be fair with existing solutions, though it is not possible unless with publishing proper artifacts.
- One way to become more interesting today, add **AI/ML** before any noun. Start from **AL/ML Systems** :) 21/12/2023
