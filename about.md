I'm a graduate student at QMUL EECS, advised by [Gianni
Antichi](https://gianniantichi.github.io/) . I'm also working with [Brent
Stephens](https://www.cs.utah.edu/~brent/) at Utah/Google. My interests center
around computer systems at data centers. Before starting PhD, I was a research
assistant at NUS advised by [Djordje Jevdjic](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/cs/people/jevdjic/), working on memory management for
data center applications. I also spent 3 months studying the feasibility
of using virtualization to increase the availability of electrical grid
controllers advised by [Jean-Yves Le
Boudec](https://people.epfl.ch/jean-yves.leboudec) at EPFL.  

I did my undergraduate and master's at IUST in Iran, working with [Mohsen
 Sharifi](https://webpages.iust.ac.ir/msharifi/). I think his lab is one of the 
best places in Iran to get to know about systems research, and learn to see 
world from Computer Systems lens.

#### What am I currently working on?
Looking for problems! 

#### Some thoughts
Hosts can get congested too, [here for more]({{ site.baseurl }}/hcongestion)  
TCP seems to be hampering the innovation.  
The process of conducting research is slow.  
People should try to be fair with existing solutions, though it is not possible unless with publishing proper atefacts.
