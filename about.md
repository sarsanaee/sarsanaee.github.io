I am currently a Linux kernel engineer at Huawei Research Cambridge. 
Also, I am a visiting researchers at Cambridge University working at Systems Research Group.
I have recently submitted my Ph.D. thesis, advised by [Gianni
Antichi](https://gianniantichi.github.io/). I worked with [Brent
Stephens](https://www.cs.utah.edu/~brent/) at Utah/Google. My interests center
around computer systems at data centers. Before starting PhD, I was a Research
Associate at NUS advised by [Djordje Jevdjic](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/cs/people/jevdjic/), working on memory management for
data center applications. I also spent 3 months studying the feasibility
of using virtualization to increase the availability of electrical grid
controllers advised by [Jean-Yves Le
Boudec](https://people.epfl.ch/jean-yves.leboudec) at EPFL.  

I did my undergraduate and master's at IUST in Iran, working with [Mohsen Sharifi](https://webpages.iust.ac.ir/msharifi/), where I spent two years as a Research Associate. I think his lab is one of the best places in Iran to get to know about systems research and learn to see the world from Computer Systems lens.

#### What am I currently working on?
I am currently collaborating with [Anuj Kalia](https://anujkalia.com/) and [Ilias Marinos](https://www.marinos.io/) on userspace networking stacks for Cloud. 

#### Some thoughts
- Hosts can get congested too, [here for more]({{ site.baseurl }}/hcongestion)  
- TCP seems to be hampering the innovation.  
- The process of conducting research is slow.  
- People should try to be fair with existing solutions, though it is not possible unless with publishing proper artifacts.
- One way to become more interesting today, add **AI/ML** before any noun. Start from **AL/ML Systems** :) 21/12/2023
