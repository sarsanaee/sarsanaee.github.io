I'm a graduate student at QMUL EECS advised by [Gianni
Antichi](https://gianniantichi.github.io/) . I'm also working with [Brent
Stephens](https://www.cs.utah.edu/~brent/) at Utah/Google. My interests centers
around computer systems at data centers. Before starting PhD, I was a research
assistant at NUS advised by Djordje Jevdjic working on memory management for
data center applications. I also spent 3 months working on studying feasibility
of using virtualization for increasing availability of electrical grid
controllers advised by [Jean-Yves Le
Boudec](https://people.epfl.ch/jean-yves.leboudec).  

I did my undergraduate and masters at IUST in Iran working with [Mohsen
 Sharifi](https://webpages.iust.ac.ir/msharifi/).

#### What am I currently working on?
Looking for problems! 

#### Some thoughts
Hosts can get congested too, [here for more]({{ site.baseurl }}/hcongestion)  
TCP seems to be hampering the innovation.  
The process of conducting research is slow.
